Jason Hogg is blogging, what good news. I have been working with Jason
for almost two years on different projects (Shadowfax, some applications
blocks, and other projects for web services). \
Jason is program manager on the Patterns & Practices team, a smart guy
and guru on web services. \
He has been writing excellent articles about WSE, SAML and his work on
Microsoft.Â  Check out his blog at

I just got great news!Â  MVP in Connected Systems for another year.

I want to thank Ed Hickey, my MVP lead [Fernando Garcia
Loera](http://blogs.msdn.com/mvplead), and the rest of people involved
in the evaluation process for once again considering my efforts in the
community worthy of recognition.

Thanks again Microsoft!!!

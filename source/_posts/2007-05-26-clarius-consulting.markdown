On June 4th, I will officially become an associate of [Clarius
Consulting](http://www.clariusconsulting.net/). I'll be joining a great
team of "all-stars" developers such as [Daniel
Cazzulino](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu), [Victor Garcia
Aprea](http://weblogs.asp.net/vga), Juan Carlos Elichirigoity and
Fernando Simonazzi, which is pretty amazing to me. Thanks guys for give
me this opportunity!!.

I'm leaving Lagash after almost five years of service. As developer and
first employee of the company, I made a lot of interesting stuff
there, most of them for the Patterns & Practices team. I'd like to
thank Lagash and wish them the best in the future!

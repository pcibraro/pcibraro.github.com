As a MVP rookie, the only thing I can say is that the event met all the
expectations I had before traveling to Seattle, the wait was worth it. I
could attend a lot of interesting sessions about WCF, WWF, and OSLO
among others, which gave me a complete picture about where Microsoft is
headed in the future with respect to Service oriented applications.

Another interesting aspect of the summit was the opportunity to meet
other MVPs in person, very smart people and community leaders like Scott
Hanselman, Roy Osherove (IXMLSerializable), Sam Gentile, Jesus Rodriguez
or Roman Kiss (The brain behind many of the cool WSE, WWF and WCF cool
samples that you can find around) to name a few.  

I look forward to attending the summit again next year :).

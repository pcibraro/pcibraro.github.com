I am so excited, this is third time I received the Microsoft MVP award.
Thanks to all people involved in the evaluation process and my MVP lead
[Fernando Garcia Loera](http://blogs.msdn.com/mvplead).

I am looking forward to continue that collaborating throughout this
year.

Thanks again Microsoft!!!

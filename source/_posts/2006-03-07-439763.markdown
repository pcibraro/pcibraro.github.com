Juval Lowy has posted an updated version of the WCF configuration schema
[here](http://www.idesign.net/idesign/temp/dotNetConfig.zip).

If you want to have intellisence support to modify the WCF configuration
files in the February CTP, you will have to download that schema and
replace the existing schema in C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual
Studio 8\\Xml\\Schemas.

This is a temporary fix for a bug in the February CTP.

WIF will be finally supported in W2k3. This has represented a big
barrier for the adoption of WIF in one of my customers for a while, but
it looks like now I will able to use it after December :).  This is the
official announcement made by the Geneva Team this weekend on their
[blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/card/archive/2009/11/24/wif-support-for-windows-server-2003.aspx),

*“Windows Identity Foundation support for Windows Server 2003 SP2 is
coming in December 2009. This package will be in English (en-US) and six
other languages: German (de-DE), Spanish (es-ES), French (fr-FR),
Italian (it-IT), Dutch (nl-NL), and Japanese (ja-JP). Stay tuned for
further updates!”*

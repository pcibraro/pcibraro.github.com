As most of you know, Pair programming is one of practices included in
Extreme Programming. It is a programming technique that provides
line-of-sight-and-hearing learning.

I have only applied this technique a few times in the past,  finding it
very useful to learn both programming techniques and problem domain.

During the last week I started to work with a very cool guy, Dustin, in
an interesting project to build some proof-of-concept applications
for his company. Dustin usually reads my blog and he decided to hire me
as a kind of consultant or mentor to guide him in the building of those
applications.

The main problem in this case was the distance, I am currently living in
Argentina and he is in USA. It was impossible to me to travel to USA
this month so we decided to use a sort of "Remote Pair Programming"
technique.  

We have a meeting almost every day and he shares his screen with me
using a tool called TighVNC (A great tool indeed, and it is open source
too).

I can not say how useful it was, we are making a lot of progress and
learning something new every day. I have just wanted to write this post
in order to share this experience since I find it very rewarding.\

If you know about other tools to do something similar, please, post a
comment.

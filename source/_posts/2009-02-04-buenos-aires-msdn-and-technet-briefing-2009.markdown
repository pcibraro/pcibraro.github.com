I just got an email from [Miguel Angel
Saenz](http://blogs.msdn.com/masaez) confirming the date of the next
biggest Microsoft event in Buenos Aires Argentina, "MSDN briefing",
which will take place on March 25th.

They are now accepting proposals or suggestions for possible sessions in
the event, or to give an specific name to event itself :).

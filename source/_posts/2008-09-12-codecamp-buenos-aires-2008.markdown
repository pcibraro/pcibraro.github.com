The next Microsoft Codecamp will take place in Buenos Aires on Saturday,
October 4th.

The agenda looks very promising, be sure to register if you want to
attend! (The complete agenda is available in the [Miguel Saenz's
blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/masaez/) , almost 10 sessions in parallel,
WOW)

I will be presenting an introductory session about the ASP.NET MVC
framework and another a little more interesting about building RESTfull
services with WCF. 

I hope to see there !!. Thanks

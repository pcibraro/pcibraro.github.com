Configuring both products to work together can be aÂ nightmare. \
I've spent almost three days trying to configure Azman and ADAM
membership providers in a normal ASP.NET application, but I couldn't.\
I wanted to use ADAM as user/group repository and Azman as authorization
repository (to have fine grained access control and manage roles). \
This
[article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/paght000018.asp)
from MSDN has helped me a lot to configure both products, but it's a
little tricky. It shows how to use ADAM as a repository for the Azman
schema, but not as authentication server. Instead it uses a windows user
to get the azman roles.\

Has anybody configured both products?. I would appreciate any help or
comments on this.

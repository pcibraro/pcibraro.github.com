My good friend [Pablo
Galiano](http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/pga/)Â has released a
pretty cool plug-in for Visual Studio 2008, [Sticky
Notes](http://stickynotes4code.com/). In a few words, this extension
allows you to attach [sticky notes to your
code](http://stickynotes4code.com/Screenshots.aspx), which can be
personal notes (Only visible to you) or team notes (visible to the
entire team).

Give it a try!!.

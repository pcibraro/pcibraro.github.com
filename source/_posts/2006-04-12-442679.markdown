Are you wondering yourself how to build service oriented applications
using the best practices in the market ?. In that case, you should
definitively take a look to this new project [Web Service Software
Factory](http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/codegallery.aspx?id=6fde9247-53a8-4879-853d-500cd2d97a83 "Web Service Software Factory") 
from the Microsoft P&P team. It was announced last week by Don Smith and
Jason Hogg in the Microsoft Canadian Architecture Forum.

\
As a part of this project, I have been working with Jason in some code
samples to show different security patterns for WCF (These patterns were
previously published for WSE 3.0).\
Other people in the development team are also working with GAT to give
tooling support and automate common tasks involved in the development of
SOA applications. (This part is really important since WCF or ASMX does
not offer good tooling support for the moment).

These are some members of the project who are also blogging,

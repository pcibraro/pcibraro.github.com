The .NetCF team is working on a subset of WCF for the next version of
the compact framework. Today I came accross this post "[Windows
Communication Foundation (Compact Edition) and the story of the Lunch
Launcher](http://blogs.msdn.com/romanbat/archive/2006/10/21/windows-communication-foundation-compact-edition-and-the-story-of-the-lunch-launcher.aspx)" from
[Roman](http://blogs.msdn.com/romanbat), a bit late because it was
published almost three months ago. Anyway,  it is still good news for
the Windows Mobile community.

As usual, Roman Kiss continues doing great stuffs for WCF. He has
recently published a new NullTransport for WCF in CodeProject.

This transport is really useful for In-Process communication when the
client and the service run on the same windows process. Before having
this transport, the recommended transport for scenario was Named pipes.

Read more about this transport in the article he published here

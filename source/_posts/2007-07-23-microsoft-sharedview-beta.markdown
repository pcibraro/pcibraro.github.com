If you haven't taken a look yet, Microsoft SharedView is a fast and easy
way to share documents and screen views with small groups of friends or
coworkers; anytime, anywhere, and what is most important, it is
completely free. This version is available up to 15 people in different
locations.

Although it is still in beta version, I have been using this product for
a while to show the progress of my work to other off-site teams, and it
works pretty well with a standard internet connection.

If you want to try it, it is
available [here](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=ddbf048d-db67-4c56-9335-6964e15975d2&DisplayLang=en).

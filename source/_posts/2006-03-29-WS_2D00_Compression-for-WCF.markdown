I have developed a new WS-Compression implementation for WCF.  This code
is based on the [WSE 3.0
implementation](http://weblogs.shockbyte.com.ar/rodolfof/archive/2006/02/07/4585.aspx "WSE 3.0 implementation") 
made by my partner [Rodolfo
Finochieti](http://weblogs.shockbyte.com.ar/rodolfof "Rodolfo Finochieti").

 

Some features provided by this implementation:

 

-   Message body compression
-   Different compression algorithms (GZIP, Deflate)
-   Different compression levels
-   Support to enable compression by means of configuration or code

 

You can download it from
[here](/images/legacy/WSCompression.zip "here")

UPDATED: A new version for the WCF september RC is
available [here](/images/legacy/WCFCompression-RC1.zip)

Enjoy :)

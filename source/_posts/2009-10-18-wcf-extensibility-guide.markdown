The first chapter of the WCF extensibility guide that
[Jesus](http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx) and I have been working on during
the last few months went live in MSDN this weekend. You can find it
here,
[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee672186.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee672186.aspx)Â 

The first chapter gives an overview of the channel layer, and some of
the extensibility points you can find there to implement custom
channels.

Enjoy!!

Today I received an email re-awarding my "Connected Systems" MVP status
for another year. Thanks Again Microsoft !! for this award.

I have been quite busy this last month, working on an interesting
project for one of the 500 fortune companies and my first incursion in
the mobile arena.\
For those who do not know, I have returned to Argentina and I am working
again for my previous company [Lagash](http://www.lagash.com).

I promise I will start blogging soon so stay tuned.

Doug Purdy and Chris Sells announced today in the mix the availability
of two new DSLs for RESTful services. MUrl for defining RESTful clients,
and MService for defining the service implementation.

More information about MUrl can be found in the Doug’s blog,

. An example is also available to download from the Oslo Dev Center,

MService, on the other hand, is a DSL for defining or creating RESTful
services. Doug just posted new information about it,

The mix session where these new technologies were shown will be

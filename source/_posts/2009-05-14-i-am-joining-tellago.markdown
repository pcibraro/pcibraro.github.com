On May 18th, I will officially become part of
[Tellago](http://tellago.com/).  I will be joining a great team with
people that I respect immensely like [Jesus
Rodriguez](http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx),
[DonXml](http://weblogs.asp.net/controlpanel/blogs/www.donxml.com), or
[Joe Klug](http://geekswithblogs.net/jklug/Default.aspx) to name a few.
Thanks guys for give me this opportunity!!.

I am leaving Clarius after almost two years of service. I got involved
in a lot of interesting projects there, and what is more important, I
had a chance to work with an excellent team of “all-stars” developers. I
would like to thank Clarius and wish them the best in the future!

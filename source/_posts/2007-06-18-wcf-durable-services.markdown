My friend [Jesus Rodriguez](http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/) has published
an excellent article about one the cool features that will be part of
WCF 3.5 (Orcas timeframe), "Durable Services". If you want to know more
about this feature, take a look at his [post
here](http://weblogs.asp.net/gsusx/archive/2007/06/14/orcas-durable-services.aspx). 

Enjoy!!.

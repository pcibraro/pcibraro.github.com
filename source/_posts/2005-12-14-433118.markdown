The Patterns & Practices team has released the web service security
patterns in the MSDN.\
This guide provides excellent material about many security patterns and
how they can be applied in different scenarios. For example, to
authenticate a client or to validate a message as well.

The patterns are grouped under the following categories:

Authentication patterns

Message protection patterns

Implementing Transport and Message Layer Security

Resource Access Patterns

Service Boundary Protection Patterns

Service Deployment Patterns

If are looking for good security practices or "security" is one of your
main concerns, I recommend you to take a look. \

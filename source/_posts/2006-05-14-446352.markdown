A month ago, a person from the Inter-American development bank offered
me a job as .NET consultant in that bank.

After thinking a while, I decided to accept his offer and travel to
Washington DC to starting work there in a project to develop some web
applications and provide consulting in .NET development.

This decision was really hard for me since it implied two important
things, working abroad in a completely different country and leaving a
wonderful company, Lagash.

The years I worked in Lagash were awesome, I had to chance to work with
the Microsoft P&P team in different projects like application blocks,
application frameworks and quickstarts, which gave me a deep knowledge
and experience with the .NET platform and I very grateful to the

Lagash guys.

I think it is the best company in Argentina to work in software
development with Microsoft technologies and you always will find good
challenges there.

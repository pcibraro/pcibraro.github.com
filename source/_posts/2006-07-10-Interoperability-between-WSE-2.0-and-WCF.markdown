[William Tay (Aka Softwaremaker)](http://www.softwaremaker.net/blog) one
of the most  knowledgeable WSE guys around has published an excellent
article about interoperability between WSE 2.0 and WCF.\
I usually find people concerned about topics like this, the different
interop issues between WSE 2.0, WSE 3.0 and WCF. \
Well, this article really helps clarify the required points to make both
products work together. In addition, it includes some code samples.

One of the blog's readers from Italy, [Fabio
Cozzolino](http://dotnetside.org/blogs/fabio/) has written a interesting
host for WCF that gets and merges configuration from different
configuration files. You can download the code from [his
post](http://dotnetside.org/blogs/fabio/archive/2007/12/15/Merge-di-file-di-configurazione-in-WCF.aspx),
which is completely in Italian. (Anyway, the code is not, it is
English).

This could be a good solution to separate the configuration in logical
partitions or divisions, and then, have a central host that consolidates
all the configuration (It is a server side solution).

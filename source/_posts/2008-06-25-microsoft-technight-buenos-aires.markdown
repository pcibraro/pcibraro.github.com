Tonight, [Daniel](http://weblogs.asp.net/cazzu) and I will be presenting
a session about "synchronization on the web" in the Microsoft Technight
event (Microsoft offices in Buenos Aires). 

We are going to talk about some of the areas in which data
synchronization is very important, and the available technologies that
can be used in those scenarios. ("FeedSync", Microsoft Framework,
Mesh4x and Live Mesh to name a few).

I hope to see you there.

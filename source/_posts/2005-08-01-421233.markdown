Nowadays, single sign-on is a common problem in many applications.
Getting some credentials from a well-known authentication authority, \
and use them later in different places is a good idea, but sometimes is
difficult to implement. \
Different vendors have implemented solutions to solve this problem, but
they lack a main attribute, "Interoperability". \
SAML comes to solve this problem, providing a secure and interoperable
protocol based on xml. \
SAML is an acronym for "Security Assertions Markup Language", a
vendor-neutral framework for exchanging security-related information
called "assertions".\
Its first specification set (1.0) was developed by the "OASIS"
consortium. \
The SAML specification doesn't define any mechanism for authentication
or authorization, instead, it establishes how identity and access
information is exchanged.\

### Sample Scenario

![](/images/legacy/SAML1.gif)

This image illustrates a client using a SAML token to consume a web
service.\
The client and the service don't know each other, but both trust in the
same authority. \
So the client can authenticate once against that authority and use the
SAML assertion to consume the service.\

### SAML implementation for WSE 3.0

An initial preview for this implementation is available in this [GDN
workspace](http://practices.gotdotnet.com/projects/saml), and it is
based on the new policy framework shipped in WSE 3.0.\
We are open to hear your feedback on on what you think about this
solution, so, don't miss this opportunity.

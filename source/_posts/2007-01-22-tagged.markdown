Thanks [Soledad](http://solepano.blogspot.com/) for tagging me.

​1. I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and I lived there until 8
months ago. Now, I am working for the Inter-American Development Bank in
Washington DC but I have plans to go back to argentina soon.

​2. I like to play video games in my spare time. My fist video game
console was an Atari 600, it was a gift from my father, then I had a
commodore 64. My latest acquisition is a PSP, and yes, I am thinking in
buying a XBox 360.

​3. I like sports; I used to play soccer twice a week with my friends,
but I haven't played anymore since I moved to the DC. Now, I go biking a
lot.

​4. I got married with my wonderful girlfriend Romina just 9 months ago.

​5. I started programming around 14 when I was in the high school, first
with Pascal and Cobol, and next year with Visual Basic 3.0. I actually
went to high school to be a car technician, but then, I changed my
mind and I started studying Computer Science. By the way, I don't know
anything about cars, just the usual things.

Now it's time to tag another 5 people :

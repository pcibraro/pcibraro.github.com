Today I found this interesting [blog
entry](http://www.oftedal.no/~erlend/?blogid=12 "blog entry") to making
WSS4J (Axis) work with WSE 3.0 using a Mutual X509 scenario (There are
two certificates, the first one for client authentication and the second
one for message protection).\
Since WSE 3.0 and WCF are compatible at wire level (I have already
developed a [sample](/cibrax/archive/2006/04/19/443402.aspx "sample") to
show this), this entry is also useful for interop testing between WCF
and WSS4J.

Some points to consider:

​1. It uses the August 2004 WS-Adressing Spec (The only one supported in
WSE 3.0)\
2. It uses WS-Security 1.0 (MutualCertificate10Security assertion)

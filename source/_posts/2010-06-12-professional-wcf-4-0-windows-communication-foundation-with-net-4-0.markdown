The book in which I been working on since last year finally went to the
light this week. It has been the result of hard work between me and
three other Connected Systems MVP, my friend [Fabio
Cozzolino](http://weblogs.asp.net/fabio/), [Kurt
Claeys](http://geekswithblogs.net/claeyskurt/Default.aspx) and Johann
Grabner. If you are interested in learning the new features in WCF 4.0,
but also WCF in general and how to apply it in real world scenarios,
this book is for you. I dedicated three chapters of this book to one of
my favorites topics, Security, from the basics to more complicated
scenarios with Claim-Based security and Federated authentication using
WCF services with Windows Identity Foundation. You can find more
information about the book and the table of contents in the Wrox web
